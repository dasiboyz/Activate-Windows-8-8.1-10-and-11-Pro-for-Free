5. Click on `Downloads`, or go to the directory where you saved the downloaded batch file. Now you are here (or on a different place):
6. Click on the batch file once, then right click and click `Run As Administrator`. It will ask for UAC permissions. Click `Yes` now. Now a console windows will open. Wait until it says `<product activation succesfull>`. Now you activated Windows Pro for free! It also asks if you wanna see someone's blog. Press `Y` if you want to and `N` if you don't want to see.
