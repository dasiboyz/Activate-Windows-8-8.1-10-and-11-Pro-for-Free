# Activate-Windows-8-8.1-10-and-11-Pro-for-Free
Activate Windows 8, 8.1, 10 and 11 Pro for Free
NOTE
If you see the Windows keyboard button <kbd><img src="./icon/icons8-windows-10-100.png" width="20"></kbd> in this guide; and you can't find it on your keyboard, you likely have/had Windows 10 which has the button <kbd><img src="./icon/icons8-windows-10-100.png" width="20"></kbd> . If you can't find that one, you likely have a PC that has been upgraded to Windows 8/8.1/10/11 from Windows 8.1/8/7/Vista/XP and other ones. If you have one of those, refer the Windows key button to as yours. A list of them is below:
- <kbd><img src="./icon/icons8-windows-11-100.png" width="20"></kbd> - **Windows 11**
- <kbd><img src="./icon/icons8-windows-10-100.png" width="20"></kbd> - **Windows 10**
- <kbd><img src="./icon/icons8-windows8-100.png" width="20"></kbd> - **Windows 8/8.1**
- <kbd><img src="./icon/icons8-windows-xp-100.png" width="20"></kbd> - **Windows XP/Vista/7**
- <kbd><img src="./icon/icons8-windows-98-100.png" width="20"></kbd> - **Windows 95/98**

 This doesn't say that your PC currently runs an older version of Windows. It is just the logo from the Windows version it came with. Your PC can always be upgraded to a newer version of Windows if it runs 64-bit and has a good CPU and GPU.

## Why?
There are so many reasons why you want to upgrade! A few famous features which you provide of:

- BitLocker - Used to better secure your storage drive in case it is stolen or for any other reason.
- Remote Desktop - Used to access your PC from anywhere by enabling a connection to your device.
- Domain or Azure Active Directory - Used to make it possible to place the PC in a domain or use Azure Active Directory.

## CREATE A RESTORE POINT!!!
Create a restore point to make sure you can roll back if something doesn't work, or anything goes wrong. You can find a tool to easily do this below.

## Restore Point Tool
The Restore Point Tool is a good tool using Batch to create a Windows restore point automatically so that you can rollback to your previous Windows edition. If needed, you can later on restore to this point to make everything working again.

## Tool Usage
1. Download the tool from [here](https://www.google.com/). <br>
2. Run the file as administrator.
3. Wait some time. You will see some text that it is working on some things.
4. When it is done, it will prompt 'Create restore point done!'.
5. It will exit, and your restore point is created!

## Restore Procedure
1. pen Settings (Not Control Panel).
2. Go to 'Info' or 'Information'.
3. Go down until you see 'Advanced System Settings' at 'Device Specifications'.
4. Click on it.
5. Go to 'System Security' section.
6. Click on 'System Restore'.
7. Click on the box at 'Select a different restore point'.
8. Select the first restore point in the list.
9. Click on 'Next'.
10. Click on 'Complete'.
11. Wait until the process is done. It should now be restored to your previous edition of Windows!

## BACKUP YOUR CURRENT KEY!!!
Backup the activation key you are currently using. This is to make sure that if the process doesn't work, you can reinstall Windows/change the edition and enter your current key, so that you can access everything again. This only applies when:

- You have bought a key online.
- It isn't connected to your Microsoft Account and is no digital license. If you have a Microsoft account with a digital license, you don't need to worry.

## Use Third Method for PERMANENT Activation!
Third is for users with PERMANENT activation. This requires you to have a Microsoft account connected with Windows. Find it by [clicking here](). **The first and second methods are NOT PERMANENT.**

## Note for Users with Unactivated Pro Edition
People which already have Pro, but not activated, can skip to this [step]().

## I Get a Notification: ```Your Windows license will expire soon``` or Something That way. What Do I Do?
Don't worry. You need to run the script again, but a recommendation: **For users which used this guide to activate with the first or second method and now get this message everytime, use the third method to activate it forever. But it requires a Microsoft account. When using Windows 8 or Windows 8.1, the third method won't work.**

## Getting Started
1. What you first need to do is open CMD (Command Prompt) as Administrator by pressing <kbd><img src="./icon/icons8-windows-11-100.png" width="20"></kbd> + R.
2. And now type in cmd.exe in the box
3. It should now look as something like this:
4. Now press the 3 keys `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Enter`.
5. Now you should have something like this:
6. Now, click on `Yes`.
7. Now you have something like this:

## The Commands
Now, type the following command: `slmgr.vbs /upk`
**Note:** this will remove your current activation key!
Now it will give an message, click on `OK`.
And now this command: `slmgr.vbs /cpky`
It will give an message once again, and click on `OK` again
And now type this command: `slmgr.vbs /ckms`
Once again click on `OK` when you get a message
