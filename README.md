NOTE
If you see the Windows keyboard button <kbd><img src="./icon/icons8-windows-10-100.png" width="20"></kbd> in this guide; and you can't find it on your keyboard, you likely have/had Windows 10 which has the button <kbd><img src="./icon/icons8-windows-10-100.png" width="20"></kbd> . If you can't find that one, you likely have a PC that has been upgraded to Windows 8/8.1/10/11 from Windows 8.1/8/7/Vista/XP and other ones. If you have one of those, refer the Windows key button to as yours. A list of them is below:
- <kbd><img src="./icon/icons8-windows-11-100.png" width="20"></kbd> - **Windows 11**
- <kbd><img src="./icon/icons8-windows-10-100.png" width="20"></kbd> - **Windows 10**
